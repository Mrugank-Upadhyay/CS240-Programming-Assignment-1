# CS240-Programming-Assignment-1


A programming assignment for my Data Structures course. Here the kWayMergeSort is meant to make an aribitrary (k) number of divisions to the input array A, and sort the array. This assignment is meant to teach us the time complexity associated with a divide and conquer sorting algorithm as well as ensure we can program such an algorithm ourselves.
